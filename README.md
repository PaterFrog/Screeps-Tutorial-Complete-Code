# ScreepsTutorialCodeComplete
Completed code compiled from all the Tutorials


I went through all five tutorials and gathered together the snippets you would enter into the Console. 
These have been put and commented into snippets.js

I further went through all five tutorials and gathered all scripts (main.js, role.builder.js, etc.) 
and compiled their "strongest" form after combining all five tutorial versions.
These have also been commented. If you've done the tutorial you will be familiar with this code,
so it should be easy to use for a simple start.

Your next personal project should perhaps be to automate the spawning of builders and upgraders?
You could then follow that up with basic tower/fortification spawning.

If you are very new to coding, please do not make the mistake of creating the perfect function
before you even have a viable "vertical slice."

That means that you want to focus first of all on having your colony set up a simple base that
has all the tools for survival. It's fine if it's weak, as long as it has all the tools you'd
consider necessariy to offer at least a token reistance.

Once you have this "vertical slice", this base with functional bits of everything neccessary,
then you can go and make each function more streamlined, more beautiful, more perfect.
