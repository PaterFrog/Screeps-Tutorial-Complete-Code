# ScreepsTutorialCodeComplete
Completed code compiled from all the Tutorials

I went through all five tutorials and gathered together the snippets you would enter into the Console. These have been put and commented into snippets.js

I further went through all five tutorials and gathered all scripts (main.js, role.builder.js, etc.) and compiled their "strongest" form after combining all five tutorial versions. These have also been commented. If you've done the tutorial you will be familiar with this code, so it should be easy to use for a simple start.

Your next personal project should perhaps be to automate the spawning of builders and upgraders? You could then follow that up with basic tower/fortification spawning. Automatic safe-mode activation.

If you are very new to coding, please do not make the mistake of creating whatever perfect function you come up with, before you even have a viable "vertical slice."
Hack it first, don't worry about making it especially nice - but do make sure to clearly comment everything. That will save you a lot of pain when you come back later to clean everything up and make it perfect.

As a new player, focus first of all on having your colony automatically set up a simple base that has all the most basic tools for survival. It's fine if it's weak, as long as it can offer a token resistance - it'll end up dying anyway, and this is expected. You will, and should, lose your initial colonies all the time. This is why you want to have the building of a new base automated _before_ you worry about form over function.

Once you have this "vertical slice", this base with functional bits of everything neccessary, then you can go and make each bit more streamlined, more beautiful, more perfect.
